		   <h3> § 4	Use of Google Analytics </h3></br>
		   
		   <p> (1)	This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookies about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymisation is enabled on this website, Google will truncate your IP address beforehand within member states of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website usage and internet usage to the website operator.
         </p></br>
	<p> (2) The IP address transmitted by Google as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other data provided by Google. </p></br>
   
   <p> (3) You can prevent the storage of cookies by a corresponding setting of your browser software; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website in full. You may also prevent the collection by Google of the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by using the browser plug-in available under the following link. Download and install: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de. </p></br>
   
   <p> (4) This website uses Google Analytics with the extension "anonymizeIp ()". As a result, IP addresses are processed then shortened, all person-relatedness can thus be excluded. Data collected about you is therefore immediately excluded and the personal data deleted immediately.</p></br>
   
   <p> (5) We use Google Analytics to analyse and regularly improve the use of our website. With the statistics we can improve our service and make it more interesting for you as a user. For the exceptional cases in which Personal Information is transferred to the US, Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US Framework. The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1(f)  GDPR.00</p></br>

Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US Framework</p></br>
  
   <p> (7) This website also uses Google Analytics for a cross-device analysis of visitor flows, which is carried out via a user ID. You can disable the cross-device analysis of your use in your customer account under "My Data", "Personal Information".</p></br>
   
    <h3> § 5 	Storage duration </h3></br>
		   
		   <p> Unless we explicitly state otherwise, we store personal data only for as long as statutory retention periods dictate. After the expiry of these legal retention periods, all data will be deleted that is no longer required to fulfil contractual obligations to you or that we can no longer invoke a legitimate interest for further storage.
